                <p className=''>"But you live like such a fool—of course you're bored!" drawled the Older Man, rummaging listlessly
                    through his pockets for the ever-elusive match. "Well, I like your nerve!" protested the Younger Man with
                    unmistakable asperity. "Do you—really?" mocked the Older Man, still smiling very faintly. For a few
                    minutes then both men resumed their cigars, staring blinkishly out all the while from their dark green
                    piazza corner into the dazzling white tennis courts that gleamed like so many slippery pine planks in the
                    afternoon glare and heat. The month was August, the day typically handsome, typically vivid, typically
                    caloric. It was the Younger Man who recovered his conversational interest first. "So you think I'm a fool?"
                    he resumed at last quite abruptly. "Oh, no—no! Not for a minute!" denied the Older Man. "Why, my dear
                    sir, I never even implied that you were a fool! All I said was that you—lived like a fool!" Starting to be
                    angry, the Younger Man laughed instead. "You're certainly rather an amusing sort of chap," he
                    acknowledged reluctantly. A gleam of real pride quickened most ingenuously in the Older Man's pale blue
                    eyes. "Why, that's just the whole point of my argument," he beamed. "Now—you look interesting. But
                    you aren't! And I—don't look interesting. But it seems that I am!" "You—you've got a nerve!" reverted the
                    Younger Man. Altogether serenely the Older Man began to rummage again through all his pockets. "Thank
                    you for your continuous compliments," he mused. "Thank you, I say. Thank you—very much. Now for the
                    very first time, sir, it's beginning to dawn on me just why you have honored me with so much of your
                    company—the past three or four days. I truly believe that you like me! Eh? But up to last Monday, if I
                    remember correctly," he added drily, "it was that showy young Philadelphia crowd that was absorbing the
                    larger part of your—valuable attention? Eh? Wasn't it?" "What in thunder are you driving at?" snapped
                    the Younger Man. "What are you trying to string me about, anyway? What's the harm if I did say that I
                    wished to glory I'd never come to this blasted hotel? Of all the stupid people! Of all the stupid places! Of
                    all the stupid—everything!" "The mountains here are considered quite remarkable by some," suggested
                    the Older Man blandly. "Mountains?" snarled the Younger Man. "Mountains? Do you think for a moment
                    that a fellow like me comes to a God-forsaken spot like this for the sake of mountains?" A trifle noisily the
                    Older Man jerked his chair around and, slouching down into his shabby gray clothes, with his hands thrust
                    deep into his pockets, his feet shoved out before him, sat staring at his companion. Furrowed abruptly
                    from brow to chin with myriad infinitesimal wrinkles of perplexity, his lean, droll face looked suddenly
                    almost monkeyish in its intentness. "What does a fellow like you come to a place like this for?" he asked
                    bluntly. "Why—tennis," conceded the Younger Man. "A little tennis. And golf—a little golf. And—and—"
                    "And—girls," asserted the Older Man with precipitous conviction. Across the Younger Man's splendidly
                    tailored shoulders a little flicker of self consciousness went crinkling. "Oh, of course," he grinned. "Oh, of
                    course I've got a vacationist's usual partiality for pretty girls. But Great Heavens!" he began, all over again.
                    "Of all the stupid—!" "But you live like such a fool—of course you're bored," resumed the Older Man.
                    "There you are at it again!" stormed the Younger Man with tempestuous resentment. "Why shouldn't I
                    be 'at it again'?" argued the Older Man mildly. "Always and forever picking out the showiest people that
                    you can find—and always and forever being bored to death with them eventually, but never learning
                    anything from it—that's you! Now wouldn't that just naturally suggest to any observing stranger that
                    there was something radically idiotic about your method of life?" "But that Miss Von Eaton looked like
                    such a peach!" protested the Younger Man worriedly. "That's exactly what I say," droned the Older Man.
                    "Why, she's the handsomest girl here!" insisted the Younger Man arrogantly. "That's exactly what I say,"
                    droned the Older Man. "And the best dresser!" boasted the Younger Man stubbornly. "That's exactly what
                    I say," droned the Older Man. "Why, just that pink paradise hat alone would have knocked almost any
                    chap silly," grinned the Younger Man a bit sheepishly. "Humph!" mused the Older Man still droningly.

                    "Humph! When a chap falls in love with a girl's hat at a summer resort, what he ought to do is to hike back
                    to town on the first train he can catch—and go find the milliner who made the hat!" "Hike back to—
                    town?" gibed the Younger Man. "Ha!" he sneered. "A chap would have to hike back a good deal farther
                    than 'town' these days to find a girl that was worth hiking back for! What in thunder's the matter with all
                    the girls?" he queried petulantly. "They get stupider and stupider every summer! Why, the peachiest
                    débutante you meet the whole season can't hold your interest much beyond the stage where you once
                    begin to call her by her first name!" Irritably, as he spoke, he reached out for a bright-covered magazine
                    from the great pile of books and papers that sprawled on the wicker table close at his elbow. "Where in
                    blazes do the story-book writers find their girls?" he demanded. Noisily with his knuckles he began to
                    knock through page after page of the magazine's big-typed advertisements concerning the year's most
                    popular story-book heroines. "Why—here are no end of story-book girls," he complained, "that could
                    keep a fellow guessing till his hair was nine shades of white! Look at the corking things they say! But what
                    earthly good are any of 'em to you? They're not real! Why, there was a little girl in a magazine story last
                    month—! Why, I could have died for her! But confound it, I say, what's the use? They're none of 'em real!
                    Nothing but moonshine! Nothing in the world, I tell you, but just plain made-up moonshine! Absolutely
                    improbable!" Slowly the Older Man drew in his long, rambling legs and crossed one knee adroitly over the
                    other. "Improbable—your grandmother!" said the Older Man. "If there's—one person on the face of this
                    earth who makes me sick it's the ninny who calls a thing 'improbable' because it happens to be outside
                    his own special, puny experience of life." Tempestuously the Younger Man slammed down his magazine
                    to the floor. "Great Heavens, man!" he demanded. "Where in thunder would a fellow like me start out to
                    find a story-book girl? A real girl, I mean!" "Almost anywhere—outside yourself," murmured the Older
                    Man blandly. "Eh?" jerked the Younger Man. "That's what I said," drawled the Older Man with unruffled
                    suavity. "But what's the use?" he added a trifle more briskly. "Though you searched a thousand years! A
                    'real girl'? Bah! You wouldn't know a 'real girl' if you saw her!" "I tell you I would!" snapped the Younger
                    Man. "I tell you—you wouldn't!" said the Older Man. "Prove it!" challenged the Younger Man. "It's already
                    proved!" confided the Older Man. "Ha! I know your type!" he persisted frankly. "You're the sort of fellow,
                    at a party, who just out of sheer fool instinct will go trampling down every other man in sight just for the
                    sheer fool joy of trying to get the first dance with the most conspicuously showy-looking, most
                    conspicuously artificial-looking girl in the room—who always and invariably 'bores you to death' before
                    the evening is over! And while you and the rest of your kind are battling together—year after year—for
                    this special privilege of being 'bored to death,' the 'real girl' that you're asking about, the marvelous girl,
                    the girl with the big, beautiful, unspoken thoughts in her head, the girl with the big, brave, undone deeds
                    in her heart, the girl that stories are made of, the girl whom you call 'improbable'—is moping off alone in
                    some dark, cold corner —or sitting forlornly partnerless against the bleak wall of the ballroom—or hiding
                    shyly up in the dressing-room—waiting to be discovered! Little Miss Still-Waters, deeper than ten
                    thousand seas! Little Miss Gunpowder, milder than the dusk before the moon ignites it! Little Miss
                    Sleeping-Beauty, waiting for her Prince!" "Oh, yes—I suppose so," conceded the Younger Man
                    impatiently. "But that Miss Von Eaton—" "Oh, it isn't that I don't know a pretty face—or hat, when I see
                    it," interrupted the Older Man nonchalantly. "It's only that I don't put my trust in 'em." With a quick
                    gesture, half audacious, half apologetic, he reached forward suddenly and tapped the Younger Man's coat
                    sleeve. "Oh, I knew just as well as you," he affirmed, "oh, I knew just as well as you—at my first glance—
                    that your gorgeous young Miss Von Eaton was excellingly handsome. But I also knew—not later certainly
                    than my second glance—that she was presumably rather stupid. You can't be interesting, you know, my
                    young friend, unless you do interesting things—and handsome creatures are proverbially lazy. Humph! If

                    Beauty is excuse enough for Being, it sure takes Plainness then to feel the real necessity for—Doing. "So,
                    speaking of hats, if it's stimulating conversation that you're after, if you're looking for something unique,
                    something significant, something really worth while—what you want to do, my young friend, is to find a
                    girl with a hat you'd be ashamed to go out with—and stay home with her! That's where you'll find the
                    brains, the originality, the vivacity, the sagacity, the real ideas!" With his first sign of genuine amusement
                    the Younger Man tipped back his head and laughed right up into the green-lined roof of the piazza. "Now
                    just whom would you specially recommend for me?" he demanded mirthfully. "Among all the feminine
                    galaxy of bores and frumps that seem to be congregated at this particular hotel—just whom would you
                    specially recommend for me? The stoop shouldered, school-marmy Botany dame with her incessant
                    garden gloves? Or? —Or—?" His whole face brightened suddenly with a rather extraordinary amount of
                    humorous malice: "Or how about that duddy-looking little Edgarton girl that I saw you talking with this

                    morning?" he asked delightedly. "Heaven knows she's colorless enough to suit even you—with her winter-
                    before-spring before-summer-before-last clothes and her voice so meek you'd have to hold her in your

                    lap to hear it. And her—" "That 'duddy-looking' little Miss Edgarton—meek?" mused the Older Man in
                    sincere astonishment. "Meek? Why, man alive, she was born in a snow-shack on the Yukon River! She was
                    at Pekin in the Boxer Rebellion! She's roped steers in Oklahoma! She's matched her embroidery silks to
                    all the sunrise tints on the Himalayas! Just why in creation should she seem meek—do you suppose—to
                    a —to a—twenty-five-dollar-a-week clerk like yourself?" "'A twenty-five-dollar-a-week clerk like myself?'"

                    the Younger Man fairly gasped. "Why—why—I'm the junior partner of the firm of Barton & Barton, stock-
                    brokers! Why, we're the biggest—" "Is that so?" quizzed the Older Man with feigned surprise. "Well—

                    well—well! I beg your pardon. But now doesn't it all go to prove just exactly what I said in the beginning—
                    that it doesn't behoove a single one of us to judge too hastily by appearances?" As if fairly overwhelmed
                    with embarrassment he sat staring silently off into space for several seconds. Then—"Speaking of this
                    Miss Edgarton," he resumed genially, "have you ever exactly sought her out—as it were—and actually
                    tried to get acquainted with her?" "No," said Barton shortly. "Why, the girl must be thirty years old!" "S—

                    o?" mused the Older Man. "Just about your age?" "I'm thirty-two," growled the Younger Man. "I'm sixty-
                    two, thank God!" acknowledged the Older Man. "And your gorgeous Miss Von Eaton—who bores you

                    so—all of a sudden—is about—?" "Twenty," prompted the Younger Man. "Poor—senile—babe,"
                    ruminated the Older Man soberly. "Eh?" gasped the Younger Man, edging forward in his chair. "Eh?
                    'Senile'? Twenty?" "Sure!" grinned the Older Man. "Twenty is nothing but the 'sere and yellow leaf' of
                    infantile caprice! But thirty is the jocund youth of character! On land or sea the Lord Almighty never made
                    anything as radiantly, divinely young as—thirty! Oh, but thirty's the darling age in a woman!" he added
                    with sudden exultant positiveness. "Thirty's the birth of individuality! Thirty's the—" "Twenty has got quite
                    enough individuality for me, thank you!" asserted Barton with some curtness. "But it hasn't!" cried the
                    Older Man hotly. "You've just confessed that it hasn't!" In an amazing impulse of protest he reached out
                    and shook his freckled fist right under the Younger Man's nose. "Twenty, I tell you, hasn't got any
                    individuality at all!" he persisted vehemently. "Twenty isn't anything at all except the threadbare cloak of
                    her father's idiosyncrasies, lined with her mother's made-over tact, trimmed with her great aunt
                    somebody's short-lipped smile, shrouding a brand-new frame of—God knows what!" "Eh? What?"
                    questioned the Younger Man uneasily. "When a girl is twenty, I tell you," persisted the Older Man—
                    "there's not one marrying man among us—Heaven help us!—who can swear whether her charm is Love's
                    own permanent food or just Nature's temporary bait! At twenty, I tell you, there's not one man among us
                    who can prove whether vivacity is temperament or just plain kiddishness; whether sweetness is real
                    disposition or just coquetry; whether tenderness is personal discrimination or just sex; whether dumbness

                    is stupidity or just brain hoarding its immature treasure; whether indeed coldness is prudery or just
                    conscious passion banking its fires! The dear daredevil sweetheart whom you worship at eighteen will
                    evolve, likelier than not, into a mighty sour prig at forty; and the dove-gray lass who led you to church
                    with her prayer-book ribbons twice every Sunday will very probably decide to go on the vaudeville stage—
                    when her children are just in the high school; and the dull-eyed wallflower whom you dodged at all your
                    college dances will turn out, ten chances to one, the only really wonderful woman you know! But at thirty!
                    Oh, ye gods, Barton! If a girl interests you at thirty you'll be utterly mad about her when she's forty—
                    fifty—sixty! If she's merry at thirty, if she's ardent, if she's tender, it's her own established merriment, it's
                    her own irreducible ardor, it's her—Why, man alive! Why—why—" "Oh, for Heaven's sake!" gasped
                    Barton. "Whoa there! Go slow! How in creation do you expect anybody to follow you?" "Follow me?
                    Follow me?" mused the Older Man perplexedly. Staring very hard at Barton, he took the opportunity to
                    swallow rather loudly once or twice. "Now speaking of Miss Edgarton," he resumed persistently, "now,
                    speaking of this Miss Edgarton, I don't presume for an instant that you're looking for a wife on this trip,
                    but are merely hankering a bit now and then for something rather specially diverting in the line of feminine
                    companionship?" "Well, what of it?" conceded the Younger Man. "This of it," argued the Older Man. "If
                    you are really craving the interesting why don't you go out and rummage around for it? Rummage around
                    was what I said! Yes! The real hundred-cent-to-the-dollar treasures of Life, you know, aren't apt to be
                    found labeled as such and lying round very loose on the smugly paved general highway! And astonishingly
                    good looks and astonishingly good clothes are pretty nearly always equivalent to a sign saying, 'I've already
                    been discovered, thank you!' But the really big sport of existence, young man, is to strike out somewhere
                    and discover things for yourself!" "Is—it?" scoffed Barton. "It is!" asserted the Older Man. "The woman, I
                    tell you, who fathoms heroism in the fellow that every one else thought was a knave—she's got something
                    to brag about! The fellow who's shrewd enough to spy unutterable lovableness in the woman that no man
                    yet has ever even remotely suspected of being lovable at all —God! It's like being Adam with the whole
                    world virgin!" "Oh, that may be all right in theory," acknowledged the Younger Man, with some reluctance.
                    "But—" "Now, speaking of Miss Edgarton," resumed the Older Man monotonously. "Oh, hang Miss
                    Edgarton!" snapped the Younger Man. "I wouldn't be seen talking to her! She hasn't any looks! She hasn't
                    any style! She hasn't any— anything! Of all the hopelessly plain girls! Of all the—!" "Now see here, my
                    young friend," begged the Older Man blandly. "The fellow who goes about the world judging women by
                    the sparkle of their eyes or the pink of their cheeks or the sheen of their hair—runs a mighty big risk of
                    being rated as just one of two things, a sensualist or a fool." "Are you trying to insult me?" demanded the
                    Younger Man furiously. Freakishly the Older Man twisted his thin-lipped mouth and one glowering
                    eyebrow into a surprisingly sudden and irresistible smile. "Why—no," he drawled. "Under all existing
                    circumstances I should think I was complimenting you pretty considerably by rating you only as a fool."
                    "Eh?" jumped Barton again. "U-m-m," mused the Older Man thoughtfully. "Now believe me, Barton, once
                    and for all, there 's no such thing as a 'hopelessly plain woman'! Every woman, I tell you, is beautiful
                    concerning the thing that she's most interested in! And a man's an everlasting dullard who can't ferret
                    out what that interest is and summon its illuminating miracle into an otherwise indifferent face—" "Is that
                    so?" sniffed Barton. Lazily the Older Man struggled to his feet and stretched his arms till his bones began
                    to crack. "Bah! What's beauty, anyway," he complained, "except just a question of where Nature has
                    concentrated her supreme forces—in outgrowing energy, which is beauty; or ingrowing energy, which is
                    brains! Now I like a little good looks as well as anybody," he confided, still yawning, "but when I see a
                    woman living altogether on the outside of her face I don't reckon too positively on there being anything
                    very exciting going on inside that face. So by the same token, when I see a woman who isn't squandering

                    any centric fires at all on the contour of her nose or the arch of her eyebrows or the flesh-tints of her
                    cheeks, it surely does pique my curiosity to know just what wonderful consuming energy she is busy about.
                    "A face isn't meant to be a living-room, anyway, Barton, but just a piazza where the seething, preoccupied
                    soul can dash out now and then to bask in the breeze and refreshment of sympathy and appreciation.
                    Surely then—it's no particular personal glory to you that your friend Miss Von Eaton's energy cavorts
                    perpetually in the gold of her hair or the blue of her eyes, because rain or shine, congeniality or
                    noncongeniality, her energy hasn't any other place to go. But I tell you it means some compliment to a
                    man when in a bleak, dour, work-worn personality like the old Botany dame's for instance he finds himself
                    able to lure out into occasional facial ecstasy the amazing vitality which has been slaving for Science alone
                    these past fifty years. Mushrooms are what the old Botany dame is interested in, Barton. Really, Barton, I
                    think you'd be surprised to see how extraordinarily beautiful the old Botany dame can be about
                    mushrooms! Gleam of the first faint streak of dawn, freshness of the wildest woodland dell, verve of the
                    long day's strenuous effort, flush of sunset and triumph, zeal of the student's evening lamp, puckering,
                    daredevil smile of reckless experiment—" "Say! Are you a preacher?" mocked the Younger Man
                    sarcastically. "No more than any old man," conceded the Older Man with unruffled good nature. "Old
                    man?" repeated Barton, skeptically. In honest if reluctant admiration for an instant, he sat appraising his
                    companion's extraordinary litheness and agility. "Ha!" he laughed. "It would take a good deal older head
                    than yours to discover what that Miss Edgarton's beauty is!" "Or a good deal younger one, perhaps,"
                    suggested the Older Man judicially. "But —but speaking of Miss Edgarton—" he began all over again.
                    "Oh—drat Miss Edgarton!" snarled the Younger Man viciously. "You've got Miss Edgarton on the brain!
                    Miss Edgarton this! Miss Edgarton that! Miss Edgarton! Who in blazes is Miss Edgarton, anyway?" "Miss
                    Edgarton? Miss Edgarton?" mused the Older Man thoughtfully. "Who is she? Miss Edgarton? Why—no
                    one special—except—just my daughter." Like a fly plunged all unwittingly upon a sheet of sticky paper
                    the Younger Man's hands and feet seemed to shoot out suddenly in every direction. "Good Heavens!" he
                    gasped. "Your daughter?" he mumbled. "Your daughter?" Every other word or phrase in the English
                    language seemed to be stricken suddenly from his lips. "Your—your—daughter?" he began all over again.
                    "Why —I—I—didn't know your name was Edgarton!" he managed finally to articulate. An expression of
                    ineffable triumph, and of triumph only, flickered in the Older Man's face. "Why, that's just what I've been
                    saying," he reiterated amiably. "You don't know anything!" Fatuously the Younger Man rose to his feet,
                    still struggling for speech—any old speech—a sentence, a word, a cough, anything, in fact, that would
                    make a noise. "Well, if little Miss Edgarton is—little Miss Edgarton," he babbled idiotically, "who in
                    creation—are you?" "Who am I?" stammered the Older Man perplexedly. As if the question really worried
                    him, he sagged back a trifle against the sustaining wall of the house, and stood with his hands thrust deep
                    in his pockets once more. "Who am I?" he repeated blandly. Again one eyebrow lifted. Again one side of
                    his thin-lipped mouth twitched ever so slightly to the right. "Why, I'm just a man, Mr. Barton," he grinned
                    very faintly, "who travels all over the world for the sake of whatever amusement he can get out of it. And
                    some afternoons, of course, I get a good deal more amusement out of it—than I do others. Eh?" Furiously
                    the red blood mounted into the Young Man's cheeks. "Oh, I say, Edgarton!" he pleaded. Mirthlessly,
                    wretchedly, a grin began to spread over his face. "Oh, I say!" he faltered. "I am a fool!" The Older Man
                    threw back his head and started to laugh. 'I am riding,' she murmured almost inaudibly 'I am riding,' she
                    murmured almost inaudibly At the first cackling syllable of the laugh, with appalling fatefulness Eve

                    Edgarton herself loomed suddenly on the scene, in her old slouch hat, her gray flannel shirt, her weather-
                    beaten khaki Norfolk and riding-breeches, looking for all the world like an extraordinarily slim,

                    extraordinarily shabby little boy just starting out to play. Up from the top of one riding-boot the butt of a

                    revolver protruded slightly. With her heavy black eyelashes shadowing somberly down across her olive
                    tinted cheeks, she passed Barton as if she did not even see him and went directly to her father. "I am
                    riding," she murmured almost inaudibly. "In this heat?" groaned her father. "In this heat," echoed Eve

                    Edgarton. "There will surely be a thunder-storm," protested her father. "There will surely be a thunder-
                    storm," acquiesced Eve Edgarton. Without further parleying she turned and strolled off again. Just for an

                    instant the Older Man's glance followed her. Just for an instant with quizzically twisted eyebrows his
                    glance flashed back sardonically to Barton's suffering face. Then very leisurely he began to laugh again.
                    But right in the middle of the laugh—as if something infinitely funnier than a joke had smitten him
                    suddenly—he stopped short, with one eyebrow stranded half-way up his forehead. "Eve!" he called
                    sharply. "Eve! Come back here a minute!" Very laggingly from around the piazza corner the girl
                    reappeared. "Eve," said her father quite abruptly, "this is Mr. Barton! Mr. Barton, this is my daughter!"
                    Listlessly the girl came forward and proffered her hand to the Younger Man. It was a very little hand. More
                    than that, it was an exceedingly cold little hand. "How do you do, sir?" she murmured almost inaudibly.
                    With an expression of ineffable joy the Older Man reached out and tapped his daughter on the shoulder.
                    "It has just transpired, my dear Eve," he beamed, "that you can do this young man here an inestimable
                    service—tell him something—teach him something, I mean—that he very specially needs to know!" As
                    one fairly teeming with benevolence he stood there smiling blandly into Barton's astonished face. "Next
                    to the pleasure of bringing together two people who like each other," he persisted, "I know of nothing
                    more poignantly diverting than the bringing together of people who—who—" Mockingly across his
                    daughter's unconscious head, malevolently through his mask of utter guilelessness and peace, he
                    challenged Barton's staring helplessness. "So—taken all in all," he drawled still beamingly, "there's nothing
                    in the world—at this particular moment, Mr. Barton—that could amuse me more than to have you join
                    my daughter in her ride this afternoon!" "Ride with me?" gasped little Eve Edgarton. "This afternoon?"
                    floundered Barton. "Oh—why—yes—of course! I'd be delighted! I'd be—be! Only—! Only I'm afraid
                    that—!" Deprecatingly with uplifted hand the Older Man refuted every protest. "No, indeed, Mr. Barton,"
                    he insisted. "Oh, no—no indeed—I assure you it won't inconvenience my daughter in the slightest! My
                    daughter is very obliging! My daughter, indeed—if I may say so in all modesty—my daughter indeed is
                    always a good deal of a—philanthropist!" Then very grandiloquently, like a man in an old-fashioned
                    picture, he began to back away from them, bowing low all the time, very, very low, first to Barton, then
                    to his daughter, then to Barton again. "I wish you both a very good afternoon!" he said. "Really, I see no
                    reason why either of you should expect a single dull moment!" "I would therefore respectfully suggest as
                    a special topic of conversation the consummate cheek of—yours truly, Paul Reymouth Edgarton" "I would
                    therefore respectfully suggest as a special topic of conversation the consummate cheek of— yours truly,
                    Paul Reymouth Edgarton" Before the sickly grin on Barton's face his own smile deepened into actual
                    unctuousness. But before the sudden woodeny set of his daughter's placid mouth his unctuousness
                    twisted just a little bit wryly on his lips. "After all, my dear young people," he asserted hurriedly, "there's
                    just one thing in the world, you know, that makes two people congenial, and that is—that they both shall
                    have arrived at exactly the same conclusion—by two totally different routes. It's got to be exactly the
                    same conclusion, else there isn't any sympathy in it. But it's got to be by two totally different routes, you
                    understand, else there isn't any talky-talk to it!" Laboriously one eyebrow began to jerk its way up his
                    forehead, and with a purely mechanical instinct he reached up drolly and pulled it down again. "So— as
                    the initial test of your mutual congeniality this afternoon," he resumed, "I would therefore respectfully
                    suggest as a special topic of conversation the consummate cheek of—yours truly, Paul Reymouth
                    Edgarton!" Starting to bow once more, he backed instead into the screen of the office window. Without

                    even an expletive he turned, pushed in the screen, clambered adroitly through the aperture, and
                    disappeared almost instantly from sight. Very faintly from some far up-stairs region the thin, faint, single
                    syllable of a laugh came floating down into the piazza corner. Then just as precipitous as a man steps into
                    any other hole, Barton stepped into the conversational topic that had just been so aptly provided for him.
                    "Is your father something of a—of a practical joker, Miss Edgarton?" he demanded with the slightest
                    possible tinge of shrillness. For the first time in Barton's knowledge of little Eve Edgarton she lifted her
                    eyes to him—great hazel eyes, great bored, dreary, hazel eyes set broadly in a too narrow olive face. "My
                    father is generally conceded to be something of a joker, I believe," she said dully. "But it would never have
                    occurred to me to call him a particularly practical one. I don't like him," she added without a flicker of
                    expression. "I don't either!" snapped Barton. A trifle uneasily little Eve Edgarton went on. "Why—once
                    when I was a tiny child—" she droned. "I don't know anything about when you were a tiny child," affirmed
                    Barton with some vehemence. "But just this afternoon—!" In striking contrast to the cool placidity of her
                    face one of Eve Edgarton's boot toes began to tap-tap-tap against the piazza floor. When she lifted her
                    eyes again to Barton their sleepy sullenness was shot through suddenly with an unmistakable flash of
                    temper. "Oh, for Heaven's sake, Mr. Barton!" she cried out. "If you insist upon riding with me, couldn't
                    you please hurry? The afternoons are so short!" "If I 'insist' upon riding with you?" gasped Barton.
                    Disconcertingly from an upper window the Older Man's face beamed suddenly down upon him. "Oh, don't
                    mind anything she says," drawled the Older Man. "It's just her cunning, 'meek' little ways." Precipitately
                    Barton bolted for his room. Once safely ensconced behind his closed door a dozen different decisions, a
                    dozen different indecisions, rioted tempestuously through his mind. To go was just as awkward as not to
                    go! Not to go was just as awkward as to go! Over and over and over one silly alternative chased the other
                    through his addled senses. Then just as precipitately as he had bolted to his room he began suddenly to
                    hurl himself into his riding-clothes, yanking out a bureau drawer here, slamming back a closet door there,
                    rummaging through a box, tipping over a trunk, yet in all his fuming haste, his raging irritability, showing
                    the same fastidious choice of shirt, tie, collar, that characterized his every public appearance. Immaculate
                    at last as a tailor's equestrian advertisement he came striding down again into the hotel office, only to
                    plunge most inopportunely into Miss Von Eaton's languorous presence. "Why, Jim!" gasped Miss Von
                    Eaton. Exquisitely white and cool and fluffy and dainty, she glanced up perplexedly at him from her lazy,
                    deep-seated chair. "Why, Jim!" she repeated, just a little bit edgily. "Riding? Riding? Well, of all things!
                    You who wouldn't even play bridge with us this afternoon on account of the heat! Well, who in the world—
                    who can it be that has cut us all out?" Teasingly she jumped up and walked to the door with him, and
                    stood there peering out beyond the cool shadow of his dark-blue shoulder into the dazzling road where,
                    like so many figures thrust forth all unwittingly into the merciless flare of a spot-light, little shabby Eve
                    Edgarton and three sweating horses waited squintingly in the dust. "Oh!" cried Miss Von Eaton. "W-hy!"
                    stammered Miss Von Eaton. "Good gracious!" giggled Miss Von Eaton. Then hysterically, with her hand
                    clapped over her mouth, she turned and fled up the stairs to confide the absurd news to her mates. With

                    a face like a graven image Barton went on down the steps into the road. In one of his thirty-dollar riding-
                    boots a disconcerting two-cent sort of squeak merely intensified his unhappy sensation of being

                    motivated purely mechanically like a doll. Two of the horses that whinnied cordially at his approach were
                    rusty roans. The third was a chunky gray. Already on one of the roans Eve Edgarton sat perched with her
                    bridle-rein oddly slashed in two, and knotted, each raw end to a stirrup, leaving her hands and arms still
                    perfectly free to hug her mysterious books and papers to her breast. "Good afternoon again, Miss
                    Edgarton," smiled Barton conscientiously. "Good afternoon again, Mr. Barton," echoed Eve Edgarton
                    listlessly. With frank curiosity he nodded toward her armful of papers. "Surely you're not going to carry—

                    all that stuff with you?" he questioned. "Yes, I am, Mr. Barton," drawled Eve Edgarton, scarcely above a
                    whisper. Worriedly he pointed to her stirrups. "But Great Scott, Miss Edgarton!" he protested. "Surely
                    you're not reckless enough to ride like that? Just guiding with your feet?" "I always—do, Mr. Barton,"
                    singsonged the girl monotonously. "But the extra horse?" cried Barton. With a sudden little chuckle of
                    relief he pointed to the chunky gray. There was a side-saddle on the chunky gray. "Who's going with us?"
                    Almost insolently little Eve Edgarton narrowed her sleepy eyes. "I always taken an extra horse with me,
                    Mr. Barton—Thank you!" she yawned, with the very faintest possible tinge of asperity. "Oh!" stammered
                    Barton quite helplessly. "O—h!" Heavily, as he spoke, he lifted one foot to his stirrup and swung up into
                    his saddle. Through all his mental misery, through all his physical discomfort, a single lovely thought
                    sustained him. There was only one really good riding road in that vicinity! And it was shady! And, thank
                    Heaven, it was most inordinately short! But Eve Edgarton falsified the thought before he was half through
                    thinking it. She swung her horse around, reared him to almost a perpendicular height, merged herself like
                    so much fluid khaki into his great, towering, threatening neck, reacted almost instantly to her own balance
                    again, and went plunging off toward the wild, rough, untraveled foot-hills and—certain destruction, any
                    unbiased onlooker would have been free to affirm! Snortingly the chunky gray went tearing after her. A
                    trifle sulkily Barton's roan took up the chase. Shade? Oh, ye gods! If Eve Edgarton knew shade when she
                    saw it she certainly gave no possible sign of such intelligence. Wherever the galloping, grass-grown road
                    hesitated between green-roofed forest and devastated wood-lot, she chose the devastated wood-lot!

                    Wherever the trotting, treacherous pasture faltered between hobbly, rock-strewn glare and soft, lush-
                    carpeted spots of shade, she chose the hobbly, rock-strewn glare! On and on and on! Till dust turned

                    sweat! And sweat turned dust again! On and on and on! With the riderless gray thudding madly after her!
                    And Barton's sulky roan balking frenziedly at each new swerve and turn! It must have been almost three

                    miles before Barton quite overtook her. Then in the scudding, transitory shadow of a growly thunder-
                    cloud she reined in suddenly, waited patiently till Barton's panting horse was nose and nose with hers,

                    and then, pushing her slouch hat back from her low, curl-fringed forehead, jogged listlessly along beside
                    him with her pale olive face turned inquiringly to his drenched, beet-colored visage. "What was it that you
                    wanted me to do for you, Mr. Barton?" she asked with a laborious sort of courtesy. "Are you writing a
                    book or something that you wanted me to help you about? Is that it? Is that what Father meant?" "Am I
                    writing a—book?" gasped Barton. Desperately he began to mop his forehead. "Writing a book? Am—I—
                    writing—a—book? Heaven forbid!" "What are you doing?" persisted the girl bluntly. "What am I doing?"
                    repeated Barton. "Why, riding with you! Trying to ride with you!" he called out grimly as, taking the lead
                    impetuously again, Eve Edgarton's horse shied off at a rabbit and went sidling down a sand-bank into a
                    brand-new area of rocks and stubble and breast-high blueberry bushes. Barton liked to ride and he rode
                    fairly well, but he was by no means an equestrian acrobat, and, quite apart from the girl's unquestionably
                    disconcerting mannerisms, the foolish floppity presence of the riderless gray rattled him more than he
                    could possibly account for. Yet to save his life he could not have told which would seem more childish—
                    to turn back in temper, or to follow on—in the same. More in helplessness than anything else he decided
                    to follow on. "On and on and on," would have described it more adequately. Blacker and blacker the
                    huddling thunder-caps spotted across the brilliant, sunny sky. Gaspier and gaspier in each lulling tree-top,
                    in each hushing bird-song, in each drooping grass-blade, the whole torrid earth seemed to be sucking in
                    its breath as if it meant never, never to exhale it again. Once more in the midst of a particularly hideous
                    glare the girl took occasion to rein in and wait for him, turning once more to his flushed, miserable
                    countenance a little face inordinately pale and serene. "If you're not writing a book, what would you like
                    to talk about, Mr. Barton?" she asked conscientiously. "Would you like to talk about peat-bog fossils?"

                    "What?" gasped Barton. "Peat-bog fossils," repeated the mild little voice. "Are you interested in peat-bog
                    fossils? Or would you rather talk about the Mississippi River pearl fisheries? Or do you care more perhaps
                    for politics? Would you like to discuss the relative financial conditions of the South American republics?"
                    Before the expression of blank despair in Barton's face, her own face fell a trifle. "No?" she ventured
                    worriedly. "No? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Barton, but you see—you see—I've never been out before with
                    anybody—my own age. So I don't know at all what you would be interested in!" "Never been out before
                    with any one her own age?" gasped Barton to himself. Merciful Heavens! what was her "own age"? There
                    in her little khaki Norfolk and old slouch hat she looked about fifteen years old—and a boy, at that.
                    Altogether wretchedly he turned and grinned at her. "Miss Edgarton," he said, "believe me, there's not
                    one thing to-day under God's heaven that does interest me—except the weather!" "The weather?" mused
                    little Eve Edgarton thoughtfully. Casually, as she spoke, she glanced down across the horses' lathered sides
                    and up into Barton's crimson face. "The weather? Oh!" she hastened anxiously to affirm. "Oh, yes! The
                    meteorological conditions certainly are interesting this summer. Do you yourself think that it's a shifting
                    of the Gulf Stream? Or just a—just a change in the paths of the cyclonic areas of low pressure?" she
                    persisted drearily. "Eh?" gasped Barton. "The weather? Heat was what I meant, Miss Edgarton! Just plain
                    heat!—DAMNED HEAT—was what I meant—if I may be so explicit, Miss Edgarton." "It is hot," conceded
                    Eve apologetically. "In fact," snapped Barton, "I think it's the hottest day I ever knew!" "Really?" droned
                    Eve Edgarton. "Really!" snapped Barton. It must have been almost half an hour before anybody spoke
                    again. Then, "Pretty hot, isn't it?" Barton began all over again. "Yes," said Eve Edgarton. "In fact," hissed
                    Barton through clenched teeth, "in fact I know it's the hottest day I ever knew!" "Really?" droned Eve
                    Edgarton. "Really!" choked Barton. Creakily under their hot, chafing saddles the sweltering roans lurched
                    off suddenly through a great snarl of bushes into a fern-shaded spring-hole and stood ankle-deep in the
                    boggy grass, guzzling noisily at food and drink, with the chunky gray crowding greedily against first one
                    rider and then the other. Quite against all intention Barton groaned aloud. His sun-scorched eyes seemed
                    fairly shriveling with the glare. His wilted linen collar slopped like a stale poultice around his tortured neck.
                    In his sticky fingers the bridle-rein itched like so much poisoned ribbon. Reaching up one small hand to
                    drag the soft flannel collar of her shirt a little farther down from her slim throat, Eve Edgarton rested her
                    chin on her knuckles for an instant and surveyed him plaintively. "Aren't—we—having—an—awful time?"
                    she whispered. Even then if she had looked woman-y, girl-y, even remotely, affectedly feminine, Barton

                    would doubtless have floundered heroically through some protesting lie. But to the frank, blunt, little-
                    boyishness of her he succumbed suddenly with a beatific grin of relief. "Yes, we certainly are!" he

                    acknowledged ruthlessly. "And what good is it?" questioned the girl most unexpectedly. "Not any good!"
                    grunted Barton. "To any one?" persisted the girl. "Not to any one!" exploded Barton. With an odd little
                    gasp of joy the girl reached out dartingly and touched Barton on his sleeve. Her face was suddenly eager,
                    active, transcendently vital. "Then oh—won't you please—please—turn round—and go home—and leave
                    me alone?" she pleaded astonishingly. "Turn round and go home?" stammered Barton. The touch on his
                    sleeve quickened a little. "Oh, yes—please, Mr. Barton!" insisted the tremulous voice. "You—you mean
                    I'm in your way?" stammered Barton. Very gravely the girl nodded her head. "Oh, yes, Mr. Barton—you're
                    terribly in my way," she acknowledged quite frankly. "Good Heavens," thought Barton, "is there a man in
                    this? Is it a tryst? Well, of all things!" Jerkily he began to back his horse out of the spring-hole, back—
                    back—back through the intricate, overgrown pathway of flapping leaves and sharp, scratchy twigs. "I am
                    very sorry, Miss Edgarton, to have forced my presence on you so!" he murmured ironically. "Oh, it isn't
                    just you!" said little Eve Edgarton quite frankly. "It's all Father's friends." Almost threateningly as she spoke
                    she jerked up her own horse's drizzling mouth and rode right at Barton as if to force him back even faster

                    through the great snarl of underbrush. "I hate clever people!" she asserted passionately. "I hate them—
                    hate them—hate them! I hate all Father's clever friends! I hate—" "But you see I'm not clever," grinned
                    Barton in spite of himself. "Oh, not clever at all," he reiterated with some grimness as an alder branch
                    slapped him stingingly across one eye. "Indeed—" he dodged and ducked and floundered, still backing,
                    backing, everlastingly backing—"indeed, your father has spent quite a lot of his valuable time this
                    afternoon assuring me—and reassuring me— that—that I'm altogether a fool!" Unrelentingly little Eve
                    Edgarton's horse kept right on forcing him back—back —back. "But if you're not one of Father's clever
                    friends—who are you?" she demanded perplexedly. "And why did you insist so on riding with me this
                    afternoon?" she cried accusingly. "I didn't exactly—insist," grinned Barton with a flush of guilt. The flush
                    of guilt added to the flush of heat made him look suddenly very confused. Across Eve Edgarton's thin little
                    face the flash of temper faded instantly into mere sulky ennui again. "Oh, dear—oh, dear," she droned.
                    "You—you didn't want to marry me, did you?" Just for one mad, panic-stricken second the whole world
                    seemed to turn black before Barton's eyes. His heart stopped beating. His ear-drums cracked. Then
                    suddenly, astonishingly, he found himself grinning into that honest little face, and answering comfortably:
                    "Why, no, Miss Edgarton, I hadn't the slightest idea in the world of wanting to marry you." "Thank God
                    for that!" gasped little Eve Edgarton. "So many of Father's friends do want to marry me," she confided
                    plaintively, still driving Barton back through that horrid scratchy thicket. "I'm so rich, you see," she
                    confided with equal simplicity, "and I know so much—there's almost always somebody in Petrozavodsk
                    or Broken Hill or Bashukulumbwe who wants to marry me." "In—where?" stammered Barton. "Why—in
                    Russia!" said little Eve Edgarton with some surprise. "And Australia! And Africa! Were you never there?"
                    "I've been in Jersey City," babbled Barton with a desperate attempt at facetiousness. "I was never there!"
                    admitted little Eve Edgarton regretfully. Vehemently with one hand she lunged forward and tried with her
                    tiny open palm to push Barton's horse a trifle faster back through the intricate thicket. Then once in the
                    open again she drew herself up with an absurd air of dignity and finality and bowed him from her
                    presence. "Good-by, Mr. Barton," she said. "Good-by, Mr. Barton." "But Miss Edgarton—" stammered
                    Barton perplexedly. Whatever his own personal joy and relief might be, the surrounding country
                    nevertheless was exceedingly wild, and the girl an extravagantly long distance from home. "But Miss
                    Edgarton—" he began all over again. "Good-by, Mr. Barton! And thank you for going home!" she added
                    conscientiously. "But what will I tell your father?" worried Barton. "Oh—hang Father," drawled the
                    indifferent little voice. "But the extra horse?" argued Barton with increasing perplexity. "The gray? If
                    you've got some date up your sleeve, don't you want me to take the gray home with me, and get him out
                    of your way?" With sluggish resentment little Eve Edgarton lifted her eyes to his. "What would the gray
                    go home with you for?" she asked tersely. "Why, how silly! Why, it's my—mother's horse! That is, we call
                    it my mother's horse," she hastened to explain. "My mother's dead, you know. She's almost always been
                    dead, I mean. So Father always makes me buy an extra place for my mother. It's just a trick of ours, a sort
                    of a custom. I play around alone so much you know. And we live in such wild places!" Casually she bent
                    over and pushed the protruding butt of her revolver a trifle farther down into her riding boot. "S'long—
                    Mr. Barton!" she called listlessly over the other, and started on, stumblingly, clatteringly, up the abruptly
                    steep and precipitous mountain trail—a little dust-colored gnome on a dust-colored horse, with the
                    dutiful gray pinking cautiously along behind her. By some odd twist of his bridle-rein the gray's chunky
                    neck arched slightly askew, and he pranced now and then from side to side of the trail as if guided thus
                    by an invisible hand. With an uncanny pucker along his spine as if he found himself suddenly deserting
                    two women instead of one, Barton went fumbling and squinting out through the dusty green shade into
                    the expected glare of the open pasture, and discovered, to his further disconcerting, that there was no

                    glare left. Before his astonished eyes he saw sun-scorched mountain-top, sun-scorched granite, sun-
                    scorched field stubble turned suddenly to shade—no cool, translucent miracle of fluctuant greens, but a

                    horrid, plushy, purple dusk under a horrid, plushy, purple sky, with a rip of lightning along the horizon, a
                    galloping gasp of furiously oncoming wind, an almost strangling stench of dust-scented rain. But before
                    he could whirl his horse about, the storm broke! Heaven fell! Hell rose! The sides of the earth caved in!
                    Chaos unspeakable tore north, east, south, west! Snortingly for one single instant the roan's panic-stricken
                    nostrils went blooming up into the cloud-burst like two parched scarlet poinsettias. Then man and beast
                    as one flesh, as one mind, went bolting back through the rain-drenched, wind ravished thicket to find their
                    mates. Up, up, up, everlastingly up, the mountain trail twisted and scrambled through the unholy
                    darkness. Now and again a slippery stone tripped the roan's fumbling feet. Now and again a swaying
                    branch slapped Barton stingingly across his straining eyes. All around and about them tortured forest trees
                    moaned and writhed in the gale. Through every cavernous vista gray sheets of rain went flapping madly
                    by them. The lightning was incredible. The thunder like the snarl of a glass sky shivering into inestimable
                    fragments. With every gasping breath beginning to rip from his poor lungs like a knifed stitch, the roan
                    still faltered on each new ledge to whinny desperately to his mate. Equally futilely from time to time,
                    Barton, with his hands cupped to his mouth, holloed—holloed—holloed—into the thunderous darkness.
                    Then at a sharp turn in the trail, magically, in a pale, transient flicker of light, loomed little Eve Edgarton's
                    boyish figure, drenched to the skin apparently, wind-driven, rain-battered, but with hands in her pockets,
                    slouch hat rakishly askew, strolling as nonchalantly down that ghastly trail as a child might come strolling
                    down a stained-glassed, Persian-carpeted stairway to meet an expected guest. In vaguely silhouetted
                    greeting for one fleet instant a little khaki arm lifted itself full length into the air. Then more precipitately
                    than any rational thing could happen, more precipitately than any rational thing could even begin to
                    happen, could even begin to begin to happen, without shock, without noise, without pain, without terror
                    or turmoil, or any time at all to fight or pray—a slice of living flame came scaling through the darkness—
                    and cut Barton's consciousness clean in two</p>
